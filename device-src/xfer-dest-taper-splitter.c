 * File Slices - Cache Information

 * if it tries to rewind and does not find a suitable slice.
 *
 * The slices should be "fast forwarded" after every part, so that the first
 * byte in part_slices is the first byte of the part; when a retry of a part is
 * required, use the iterator methods to properly open the various files and do
 * the buffering.
