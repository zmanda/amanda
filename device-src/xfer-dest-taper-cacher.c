/* Future Plans:
 * - capture EOF early enough to avoid wasting a tape when the part size is an even multiple of the volume size - maybe reader thread can just go back and tag previous slab with EOF in that case?
 * - use mmap to make the disk-cacher thread unnecessary, if supported, by simply mapping slabs into the disk cache file
 * - can we find a way to fall back to mem_cache when the disk cache gets ENOSPC? Does it even make sense to try, since this would change the part size?
 * - distinguish some permanent device errors and do not retry the part? (this will be a change of behavior)
