# If amanda cannot find a tape on which to store backups, it will run
# as many backups as it can to the holding disks.  In order to save
# space for unattended backups, by default, amanda will only perform
# incremental backups in this case, i.e., it will reserve 100% of the
# holding disk space for the so-called degraded mode backups.
# However, if you specify a different value for the `reserve'
# parameter, amanda will not degrade backups if they will fit in the
# non-reserved portion of the holding disk.

# reserve 30 # percent
# This means save at least 30% of the holding disk space for degraded
# mode backups.  

autoflush no 
# if autoflush is set to yes, then amdump will schedule all dump on
# holding disks to be flush to tape during the run.

# Amanda needs a few Mb of diskspace for the log and debug files,
# as well as a database.  This stuff can grow large, so the conf directory
# isn't usually appropriate.  Some sites use /usr/local/var and some /var/lib.
# Create an amanda directory under there.  You need a separate infofile and
# logdir for each configuration, so create subdirectories for each conf and
# put the files there.  Specify the locations below.

# Note that, although the keyword below is infofile, it is only so for
# historic reasons, since now it is supposed to be a directory (unless
# you have selected some database format other than the `text' default)
infofile "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@/curinfo"      # database DIRECTORY
logdir   "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@"              # log directory
indexdir "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@/index"        # index directory
#tapelist "@CONFIG_DIR/DailySet1/tapelist"	# list of used tapes
# tapelist is stored, by default, in the directory that contains amanda.conf

# Specify holding disks.  These are used as a temporary staging area for
# dumps before they are written to tape and are recommended for most sites.
# The advantages include: tape drive is more likely to operate in streaming
# mode (which reduces tape and drive wear, reduces total dump time); multiple
# dumps can be done in parallel (which can dramatically reduce total dump time.
# The main disadvantage is that dumps on the holding disk need to be flushed
# (with amflush) to tape after an operating system crash or a tape failure.
# If no holding disks are specified then all dumps will be written directly
# to tape.  If a dump is too big to fit on the holding disk than it will be
# written directly to tape.  If more than one holding disk is specified then
# they will all be used based on activity and available space.

# network interfaces
#
# These are referred to by the disklist file.  They define the attributes
# of the network interface that the remote machine is accessed through.
# Notes: - netusage above defines the attributes t
#          disklist entry doesn't specify otherwise.
#        - the values below are only samples.
#        - specifying an interface does not force the traffic to pass
#          through that interface.  Your OS routing tables do that.  This
#          is just a mechanism to stop Amanda trashing your network.
# Attributes are:
#	use		- bandwidth above which amanda won't start
#			  backups using this interface.  Note that if
#			  a single backup will take more than that,
#			  amanda won't try to make it run slower!
