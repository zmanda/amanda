# flush-threshold-dumped, flush-threshold-scheduled, taperflush, and autoflush
# are used to control tape utilization. See the amanda.conf (5) manpage for
# details on how they work. Taping will not start until all criteria are
# satisfied. Here are some examples:
#
# You want to fill tapes completely even in the case of failed dumps, and
# don't care if some dumps are left on the holding disk after a run:
# flush-threshold-dumped	100 # (or more)
# flush-threshold-scheduled	100 # (or more)
# taperflush			100
# autoflush			yes
#
# You want to improve tape performance by waiting for a complete tape of data
# before writing anything. However, all dumps will be flushed; none will
# be left on the holding disk.
# flush-threshold-dumped	100 # (or more)
# flush-threshold-scheduled	100 # (or more)
# taperflush	0
#
# You don't want to use a new tape for every run, but want to start writing
# to tape as soon as possible:
# flush-threshold-dumped	0   # (or more)
# flush-threshold-scheduled	100 # (or more)
# taperflush	100
# autoflush     yes
# maxdumpsize   100k # amount of data to dump each run; see above.
#
# You want to keep the most recent dumps on holding disk, for faster recovery.
# Older dumps will be rotated to tape during each run.
# flush-threshold-dumped	300 # (or more)
# flush-threshold-scheduled	300 # (or more)
# taperflush	300
# autoflush     yes

# Specify holding disks.  These are used as a temporary staging area for
# dumps before they are written to tape and are recommended for most sites.
# The advantages include: tape drive is more likely to operate in streaming
# mode (which reduces tape and drive wear, reduces total dump time); multiple
# dumps can be done in parallel (which can dramatically reduce total dump time.
# The main disadvantage is that dumps on the holding disk need to be flushed
# (with amflush) to tape after an operating system crash or a tape failure.
# If no holding disks are specified then all dumps will be written directly
# to tape.  If a dump is too big to fit on the holding disk than it will be
# written directly to tape.  If more than one holding disk is specified then
# they will all be used based on activity and available space.

# If amanda cannot find a tape on which to store backups, it will run
# as many backups as it can to the holding disks.  In order to save
# space for unattended backups, by default, amanda will only perform
# incremental backups in this case, i.e., it will reserve 100% of the
# holding disk space for the so-called degraded mode backups.
# However, if you specify a different value for the `reserve'
# parameter, amanda will not degrade backups if they will fit in the
# non-reserved portion of the holding disk.

# reserve 30 # percent
# This means save at least 30% of the holding disk space for degraded
# mode backups.  

# The format for a ColumnSpec is a ',' seperated list of triples.
# Each triple consists of

#     to the maximum length of a line to print.

# You need only specify those colums that should be changed from

# Amanda needs a few Mb of diskspace for the log and debug files,
# as well as a database.  This stuff can grow large, so the conf directory
# isn't usually appropriate.  Some sites use /usr/local/var and some /usr/adm.
# Create an amanda directory under there.  You need a separate infofile and
# logdir for each configuration, so create subdirectories for each conf and
# put the files there.  Specify the locations below.

# Note that, although the keyword below is infofile, it is only so for
# historic reasons, since now it is supposed to be a directory (unless
# you have selected some database format other than the `text' default)
infofile "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@/curinfo"	# database DIRECTORY
logdir   "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@"		# log directory
indexdir "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@/index"		# index directory
#tapelist "@CONFIG_DIR@/@DEFAULT_CONFIG@/tapelist"	# list of used tapes
# tapelist is stored, by default, in the directory that contains amanda.conf

# tapetypes

# Define the type of tape you use here, and use it in "tapetype"
# above.  Some typical types of tapes are included here.  The tapetype
# tells amanda how many MB will fit on the tape, how big the filemarks
# are, and how fast the tape device is.

# A filemark is the amount of wasted space every time a tape section
# ends.

# For completeness Amanda should calculate the inter-record gaps too,
# but it doesn't.  For EXABYTE and DAT tapes this is ok.  Anyone using
# 9 tracks for amanda and need IRG calculations?  Drop me a note if
# so.

# If you want amanda to print postscript paper tape labels
# add a line after the comment in the tapetype of the form
#    lbl-templ "/path/to/postscript/template/label.ps"

# if you want the label to go to a printer other than the default
# for your system, you can also add a line above for a different
# printer. (i usually add that line after the dumpuser specification)

# dumpuser "operator"     # the user to run dumps under
# printer "mypostscript"  # printer to print paper label on

# dumptypes
#
# These are referred to by the disklist file.  The dumptype specifies
# certain parameters for dumping including:
#   auth	- authentication scheme to use between server and client.
#		  Valid values are "bsd", "bsdudp", "bsdtcp", "krb5", "local",
#		  "rsh" and "ssh".  
#		  Default: [auth "bsd"]
#   comment	- just a comment string
#   comprate	- set default compression rate.  Should be followed by one or
#		  two numbers, optionally separated by a comma.  The 1st is
#		  the full compression rate; the 2nd is the incremental rate.
#		  If the second is omitted, it is assumed equal to the first.
#		  The numbers represent the amount of the original file the
#		  compressed file is expected to take up.
#		  Default: [comprate 0.50, 0.50]
#   compress	- specify compression of the backed up data.  Valid values are:
#		  "none"        - don't compress the dump output.
#		  "client best" - compress on the client using the best (and
#				  probably slowest) algorithm.
#		  "client fast" - compress on the client using fast algorithm.
#	          "client custom" - compress using your custom client compression program.
#				    use client_custom_compress "PROG" to specify
#				    the custom compression program.
#				    PROG must not contain white space.
#		  "server best" - compress on the tape host using the best (and
#				  probably slowest) algorithm.
#		  "server fast" - compress on the tape host using a fast
#				  algorithm.  This may be useful when a fast
#				  tape host is backing up slow clients.
#	          "server custom" - compress using your server custom compression program.
#				    use server_custom_compress "PROG" to specify
#				    the custom compression program.
#				    PROG must not contain white space.
#		  Default: [compress client fast]
#   dumpcycle	- set the number of days in the dump cycle, ie, set how often a
#		  full dump should be performed.  Default: from DUMPCYCLE above
#   estimate      Determine the way AMANDA does it's estimate. 
#		  "client"	- Use the same program as the dumping program,
#				this is the most accurate way to do estimates, 
#				but it can take a long time.
#		  "calcsize"	- Use a faster program to do estimates, but the
#		  		result is less accurate.
#		  "server"	- Use only statistics from the previous run to 
#				give an estimate, 
#				it takes only a few seconds but the result is not 
#				accurate if your disk usage changes from day to day.
#		  Default: [client]
#   encrypt  - specify encryption of the backed up data. Valid values are:
#		  "none"   - don't encrypt the dump output.
#		  "client" - encrypt on the client using the program specified by 
#                            client_encrypt "PROG".
#			     Use client_decrypt_option to specify the decrypt- 
#                            parameter, default is "-d".
#                            PROG and decrypt-parameter must not contain white space.     
#		  "server" - encrypt on the server using the program specified by 
#                            server_encrypt "PROG".
#                            Use server_decrypt_option to specify the decrypt- 
#                            parameter, default is "-d".
#                            PROG and decrypt-parameter must not contain white space.
#                 Default: [none]
#   exclude	- specify files and directories to be excluded from the dump.
#		  Useful with gnutar only; silently ignored by dump and samba.
#		  Valid values are:
#		  "pattern"       - a shell glob pattern defining which files
#				    to exclude.
#				    gnutar gets --exclude="pattern"
#		  list "filename" - a file (on the client!) containing patterns
#				    re's (1 per line) defining which files to
#				    exclude.
#				    gnutar gets --exclude-from="filename"
#		  Note that the `full pathname' of a file within its
#		  filesystem starts with `./', because of the way amanda runs
#		  gnutar: `tar -C $mountpoint -cf - --lots-of-options .' (note
#		  the final dot!)  Thus, if you're backing up `/usr' with a
#		  diskfile entry like ``host /usr gnutar-root', but you don't
#		  want to backup /usr/tmp, your exclude list should contain
#		  the pattern `./tmp', as this is relative to the `/usr' above.
#		  Please refer to the man-page of gnutar for more information.
#		  If a relative pathname is specified as the exclude list,
#		  it is searched from within the directory that is
#		  going to be backed up.
#		  Default: include all files
#   holdingdisk	- should the holding disk be used for this dump.  Useful for
#		  dumping the holding disk itself.  Default: [holdingdisk auto]
#		  "never"    - Never use the holding disk.
#		  "auto"     - Use the holding disk if possible.
#		  "required" - Always use the holding disk.
#   ignore	- do not back this filesystem up.  Useful for sharing a single
#		  disklist in several configurations.
#   index	- keep an index of the files backed up.  Default: [index no]
#   kencrypt	- encrypt the data stream between the client and server.
#		  Default: [kencrypt no]
#   maxdumps	- max number of concurrent dumps to run on the client.
#		  Default: [maxdumps 1]
#   maxpromoteday - max number of day for a promotion, set it 0 if you don't
#		  want promotion, set it to 1 or 2 if your disk get
#		  overpromoted.
#		  Default: [10000]
#   priority	- priority level of the dump.  Valid levels are "low", "medium"
#		  or "high".  These are really only used when Amanda has no
#		  tape to write to because of some error.  In that "degraded
#		  mode", as many incrementals as will fit on the holding disk
#		  are done, higher priority first, to insure the important
#		  disks are at least dumped.  Default: [priority medium]
#   program	- specify the dump system to use.  Valid values are "DUMP",
#                 or "GNUTAR".  Default: [program "DUMP"].
#   record	- record the backup in the time-stamp-database of the backup
#		  program (e.g. /etc/dumpdates for DUMP or
#		  @GNUTAR_LISTED_INCREMENTAL_DIRX@ for GNUTAR.).
#		  Default: [record yes]
#   skip-full	- skip the disk when a level 0 is due, to allow full backups
#		  outside Amanda, eg when the machine is in single-user mode.
#   skip-incr	- skip the disk when the level 0 is NOT due.  This is used in
#		  archive configurations, where only full dumps are done and
#		  the tapes saved.
#   starttime	- delay the start of the dump?  Default: no delay
#   strategy	- set the dump strategy.  Valid strategies are currently:
#		  "standard" - the standard one.
#		  "nofull"   - do level 1 dumps every time.  This can be used,
#			       for example, for small root filesystems that
#			       only change slightly relative to a site-wide
#			       prototype.  Amanda then backs up just the
#			       changes.
#		  "noinc"    - do level 0 dumps every time.
#		  "skip"     - skip all dumps.  Useful for sharing a single
#			       disklist in several configurations.
#		  "incronly" - do only incremental dumps. This is similar
#                              to strategy 'nofull', but will increase
#                              the dump level as usual. Full dumps will
#                              only be performed when an 'amadmin force' 
#                              has been issued 
#		  Default: [strategy standard]
# tape_splitsize - (optional) split dump file into pieces of a specified size.
#		  This allows dumps to be spread across multiple tapes, and can
#		  potentially make more efficient use of tape space.  Note that
#		  if this value is too large (more than half the size of the
#		  average dump being split), substantial tape space can be
#		  wasted.  If too small, large dumps will be split into
#		  innumerable tiny dumpfiles, adding to restoration complexity.
#		  A good rule of thumb, usually, is 1/10 of the size of your
#		  tape.  Default: [disabled]
# split_diskbuffer - (optional) When dumping a split dump  in  PORT-WRITE
#                 mode (usually meaning "no holding disk"), buffer the split
#		  chunks to a file in the directory specified by this option.
#		  Default: [none]
# fallback_splitsize - (optional) When dumping a split dump  in  PORT-WRITE
#                 mode, if no split_diskbuffer is specified (or if we somehow
#                 fail to use our split_diskbuffer), we must buffer split
#                 chunks in memory.  This specifies the maximum size split
#                 chunks can be in this scenario, and thus the maximum amount
#                 of memory consumed for in-memory splitting.  Default: [10m]
#
# Note that you may specify previously defined dumptypes as a shorthand way of
# defining parameters.

# network interfaces
#
# These are referred to by the disklist file.  They define the attributes
# of the network interface that the remote machine is accessed through.
# Notes: - netusage above defines the attributes that are used when the
#          disklist entry doesn't specify otherwise.
#        - the values below are only samples.
#        - specifying an interface does not force the traffic to pass
#          through that interface.  Your OS routing tables do that.  This
#          is just a mechanism to stop Amanda trashing your network.
# Attributes are:
#	use		- bandwidth above which amanda won't start
#			  backups using this interface.  Note that if
#			  a single backup will take more than that,
#			  amanda won't try to make it run slower!
