Name

amgetconf  look up amanda.conf variables

Synopsis

amgetconf [config] parameter [ -o | configoption ]*

DESCRIPTION

Amgetconf looks up parameters in amanda.conf, the Amanda configuration file, or
from the build and runtime environment, and returns their corresponding value.
If config is not specified, amgetconf assumes it is being run from the
configuration directory and that amanda.conf is present.
If parameter begins with build., the (case insensitive) string following the
period is a build environment variable. Variables without a value (e.g. XFSDUMP
on a system that does not support that type of file system) will not report an
error and will return an empty string as the value. Flag variables (e.g.
USE_AMANDAHOSTS) will return 1 if the flag is set or an empty string if it is
not.
If parameter begins with dbopen., the string following the period is a program
name and an Amanda debug file will be created for the caller. The name of the
file is returned.
If parameter begins with dbclose., the string following the period is a program
name previously used with dbopen., followed by a colon (:) and the previously
opened file name.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS



  -o configoption
      See the "CONFIGURATION OVERWRITE" section in amanda(8).


EXAMPLE

Find out the path to the log file directory:

% amgetconf daily logdir
/usr/local/etc/amanda//daily
Find out the current tape type:

% amgetconf daily tapetype
DLT4000-IV
Find out the default configuration directory:

% amgetconf daily build.CONFIG_DIR
/usr/local/etc/amanda/
Create, use and close a debug file in a script:

% set debug_file = `amgetconf daily dbopen.myscript`
% echo debug information >> $debug_file
% amgetconf daily dbclose.myscript:$debug_file

MESSAGES



  amgetconf: no such parameter param
      Parameter param is not a known keyword (e.g. not a valid amanda.conf
      keyword). In this case, amgetconf will write "BUGGY" to stdout as the
      value.
