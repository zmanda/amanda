  Now that you mention that, it comes to my mind that the current
  mechanism to define backup strategies is too limited, and we could try
  to improve it just like we are going to do with the DUMPER API.

  We could define a STRATEGY API, that planner would use to:

  1) define a set levels and/or dates for which estimates should be requested

  2) select a subset of the estimate results that planner can choose

  and driver would run to inform that a backup has succeeded, after
  having updated the database.

  I haven't fully analysed the implications of this choice, but it looks
  quite feasible and very useful.  Opinions?  Requests of clarification?
  Random flames? :-)

  Anyone willing to pursue this issue?
