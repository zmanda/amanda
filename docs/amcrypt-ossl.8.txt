Name

amcrypt-ossl  crypt program for Amanda symmetric data encryption using OpenSSL

Synopsis

amcrypt-ossl [-d]

DESCRIPTION

amcrypt-ossl uses OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt data. OpenSSL is available
from www.openssl.org. OpenSSL offers a wide variety of cipher choices
( amcrypt-ossl defaults to 256-bit AES) and can use hardware cryptographic
accelerators on several platforms.
amcrypt-ossl will search for the OpenSSL program in the following directories:
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ssl/bin:/usr/local/ssl/bin.

PASSPHRASE MANAGEMENT

amcrypt-ossl uses the same pass phrase to encrypt and decrypt data. It is very
important to store and protect the pass phrase properly. Encrypted backup data
can only be recovered with the correct passphrase.
OpenSSL's key derivation routines use a salt to guard against dictionary
attacks on the pass phrase; still it is important to pick a pass phrase that is
hard to guess. The Diceware method (see www.diceware.com) can be used to create
passphrases that are difficult to guess and easy to remember.

FILES



  /var/lib/amanda/.am_passphrase
      File containing the pass phrase. It should not be readable by any user
      other than the Amanda user.
