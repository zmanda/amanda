 Installation

Amanda is able to back up Microsoft Windows shared disks by using Samba, a
package that implements a SMB client and server for Unix:
http://www.samba.org

Note

This is old stuff and will be (re)moved soon:
Releases from 1.9.18p5 up to 1.9.18p10 logged information in the tar files
produced, making them unusable! If you really must use a release prior to Samba
2.0.6, a patch that fixes the problem is available in the Amanda patches page:
http://www.amanda.org/patches/
Amanda no longer supports Samba releases prior to 1.9.18. If you're using Samba
from 1.9.18 through 1.9.18p3, make sure you don't set a low logging/debugging
level in smb.conf. This flag may prevent estimate sizes from printing correctly
and Amanda will report an estimate failure.
This problem may also occur if you have large (>2GB) shares with Samba prior to
2.0.4. In this case, apply samba2-largefs.patch from the Amanda patches page
(http://www.amanda.org/patches/).
After building and installing Samba, Amanda must be configured with support for
smbclient. Amanda will automatically find smbclient if it is in your PATH when
you run configure, or you may add the following argument:

  --with-smbclient=/full/path/to/smbclient


 Setup

Once Amanda and Samba are installed, the only difference between a Unix client/
disk and PC client/share is in how the backup disks are specified in the file
disklist. For each PC share, the entry lists the 'samba server' host (where the
patched Samba software is installed) and the disk field is the share name. The
remaining fields are like any other DLE.
A user must be created on the PC with full access rights (read/write) to the
share. Amanda, via the Samba server, will connect to the PC via this user. If
the user does not have full access, incremental backups will not work and the
whole share will be backed up every time (the archive bits are never reset).
The file /etc/amandapass must be created by hand. It contains share name to
user name, password and workgroup mapping. Each line consists of two or three
fields, separated by whitespace:

* Share name followed by optional directory.
  You have to use forward slashes (/), not backslashes (\). This must match the
  disklist entry exactly (case sensitive). This may be asterisk (*) to match
  all remaining shares for this Samba server. The first match in the file is
  used, so specific entries must be listed first. The directory is appended to
  the share name as full MS network path. Like //thepc/c$/mydir. No blanks are
  allowed in directory!
* User name and password.
  Separated by a percent sign (%). See the description of the -U option in the
  manpage of smbclient. No whitespace is allowed in either the user name or
  password.
* Workgroup (optional).

This file must be owned by the Amanda-user, and disallow world access
privileges. Blank lines are ignored. A "#" on a line at the start of a field
(including start of line) causes the rest of the line to be ignored.

 Example

The Amanda client software and (patched) Samba is installed on host "pcserver".
A share to be backed up called "backupc" is on PC "thepc". The share will be
accessed via PC user "bozo" and password "f00bar" and does not require a
workgroup.
The entry in the file disklist is:

  pcserver	//thepc/backupc		nocomp-user-gnutar

  ^ samba installed unix host
                  ^ pc host and share name
  					^ dumptype must include the tar option

In /etc/amandapass on the machine 'pcserver':

  //thepc/backupc		bozo%f00bar

If smbclient requires a workgroup specification (-W), you may add it as a third
argument in the line in the file /etc/amandapass :

  //thepc/backupc		bozo%f00bar	NTGROUP

This will cause smbclient to be invoked with -W NTGROUP.
An example dumptype in amanda.conf would be:

  define dumptype nocomp-user-gnutar {
      program "GNUTAR"
      comment "user partitions dumped with tar and no compression"
      options no-compress
      priority medium
  }

Essentially, the entry in disklist is a 'pseudo-disk' which contains all the
relevant information needed by smbclient to backup the disk, but in a way that
is compatible to Amanda.
amcheck does a quick check to see if smbclient exists and tries to connect to
the PC clients. It also checks for the existence and permissions of /etc/
amandapass.

 Bugs and notes

Samba will not back up open files (such as PAGEFILE.SYS and registry files) nor
Access Control List data. Furthermore, at restore time, smbclient is unable to
overwrite read-only files. Hence, Amanda+Samba is not a perfect solution for
backing up (restoring, actually) system disks.
Samba does not use the Windows Backup API, so configuring the Amanda backup
user as a member of group backup on the Windows host is useless. You will
probably have to configure it as an Administrator, and make sure it can read
and change permission of all files in the share.
It seems impossible to detect when a per-user based login fails, e.g. the
username doesn't have sufficient access. It connects but cannot see any files
(e.g. backups do nothing). The selfcheck code isn't particularly robust in this
area either, so you may get no warnings when a disk isn't being backed up. Just
check to see that level 0 dumps are bigger than 64K, otherwise it means the
backup was empty.
The estimate and totals are probably a bit off since tar pads to the nearest
512 bytes after each file (I think). Not sure how much of a problem this is.
smbclient only supports excluding a single file from the command line, not a
file of patterns like GNU tar. So "exclude" is supported from a dumptype but
not "exclude list".

Note

Also the new option "exclude append" is not yet supported with smbclient.

Note

Since Samba-3.0.2a smbclient supports multiple exclusion-patterns. It is one of
the "Ongoing Projects" to make use of this in Amanda. Refer to http://
www.amanda.org/ongoing.php for details.
The size estimate calculation does not use the same method as the dump, so it
may be inaccurate. It also does not support any type of exclusion ("exclude" is
ignored). Things are done this way because doing a simulated dump to /dev/null,
like other dump programs, would take forever with current implementations of
Samba.
If you compile with support for smbclient, GNU-tar support is automatically
enabled. If you aren't using the GNU-tar part, you may get warnings about the
availability of /usr/local/bin/gtar (or whatever it was compiled with). These
may safely be ignored, unless you enable index generation for those
filesystems.
