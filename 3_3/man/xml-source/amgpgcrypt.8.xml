<refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>&amgpgcrypt;
calls <emphasis remap='B'>gpg</emphasis> to perform public-key data encryption
on Amanda backup.
&amgpgcrypt; will search for the gpg program in the following directories:
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin</para>
<para>&amgpgcrypt; sets GNUPGHOME to $AMANDA_HOME/.gnupg where gpg will look for the
gpg keys.
&amgpgcrypt; uses the public key to encrypt the Amanda data
and uses the private key to decrypt the Amanda backup data. Thus, passphrase is only
required at the time of data restore.</para> 
</refsect1>


<refsect1><title>Key and Passphrase</title>
<para>&amgpgcrypt; uses the  private key to decrypt Amanda backup data.</para>
It is very important to store, manage and  protect the key and the passphrase
properly. Encrypted backup data can <emphasis remap='B'>only</emphasis> be recovered with the correct key and
passphrase.
</refsect1>



<refsect1><title>How to create encryption keys and Passphrase for amgpgcrypt</title>

<para>Store the  passphrase that you used in following "gpg --gen-key" command  inside the home-directory of the AMANDA-user($amanda_user) and protect it with proper permissions:</para>
   echo my_secret_passphrase > ~$amanda_user/.am_passphrase
   chown $amanda_user:disk ~$amanda_user/.am_passphrase
   chmod 700 ~$amanda_user/.am_passphrase
<para> Run "gpg --gen-key". Below is an example:</para>

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
