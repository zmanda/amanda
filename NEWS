Changes in release 2.4.2

* Samba passwords are now sent to smbclient via a pipe and never displayed.
* Debug files in /tmp/amanda (--with-debug-dir) are now timestamped and old
  ones automatically cleaned out.  This means more space (a few KBytes) will
  be used since in a given run, several of the programs are called more than
  once.  But it also means important debugging information should no longer
  be lost by the file being overwritten.  The length of time to keep the
  files is controlled by --with-debug-days (default: 4).  The old flag
  --with-pid-debug-files is no longer needed and is ignored.

Changes in release 2.4.1

* FAQ for new users, in docs/FAQ.
* A new `runspercycle' keyword in amanda.conf to specify the number
  of amdump runs in a dumpcycle. The default is one run every day.
  A value of 0 (the default) means the same value as dumpcycle.  
  A value of -1 means guess the number of runs from the tapelist file,
  which is the number of tape used in the last dumpcycle days / runtapes.
  If you don't run amdump every days, you must set runspercycle
  otherwise amanda will noy be able to balance the dump. You must
  set runspercycle to -1 if you want the same behavior as previous
  version of amanda.
* Space to be use as holding disk can now be "use all space except ??? Kb"
  using a negative value for the 'use' parameter.

* Tapes can now be marked so as not to be recycled with amadmin no-reuse.
* amidxtrm will no longer remove index files of backups in active tapes.
* Large dumps can now be split into multiple files on holding disk
  (but they won't span across tapes yet).
* A total estimate time-out may be specified.
* Fixed skip-incr and skip-full support.
* amcheck now accepts -Maddress to send e-mail to the specified address.
* amdump, amflush and amcheck will use the log files as locks, so as
  to avoid running concurrently.
* driver now supports configurable level-0 dumps in degraded mode via
  new amanda.conf keyword "reserve"; see docs/WHATS.NEW for details.
* Configure now looks for vxdump and vxrestore in /usr/lib/fs/vxfs for Solaris
  systems and will use it vxdump/vxrestore automatically on vxfs filesystems.
* New `killpgrp' setuid-root program, that kills estimate dumps even
  if they are setuid-root.

Changes in release 2.4.0p1

* Fixed kerberos encryption

* New text database format, to replace dbm/ndbm/gdbm/db databases with
  a more portable and user-friendly format.
* Index files are now sent through a separate TCP connection, as they
  are generated, instead of being stored in /tmp.  This breaks Amanda
  protocol backward compatibility.
* Estimates are now performed concurrently, if maxdumps>1.
* At configure time, it is now possible to specify a suffix for amanda
  service names (--with-testing=suffix) and a directory for debugging
  files (--with-debugging=/directory/name)
* New tape changer configuration keywords, that partially standardize
  tape changer script configuration interface.
* amrecover can now handle GNU tar and AIX dump restores; it must now
  be run as root.

* Extended regular expression syntax has been adopted.
* amcheck will no longer report failures about unused programs.
* It is now possible to specify a SAMBA username at configure time.

* Amdump will wait if a file named `hold' exists in the log directory.
* Various bugfixes and new ports.

Changes in release 2.3.0.4
* New chg-generic.conf option 'multieject' added which lets
  chg-generic work on tape drives that need multiple 'mt offline'
  commands.  See examples/chg-generic.conf for more information.
* New configure options:
  --with-db=DBLIB	   Force database library choice from {db,dbm,gdbm,ndbm}

* Include the file seagate-changer.c which controls
  Seagate/Conner/Archive autoloading DAT drive on NetBSD systems.
* Add a new amanda.conf option named "starttime" which is used in the
  dumptype configuration.  It takes one argument which is a time of day
  (local timezone) formated as either hhmm or hmm (no `.'s, no `:'s,
  just an integer).  This tells Amanda to start a particular dump at
  the given time.
* Index files are now retrieved from the clients through amandad, not rsh/rcp.
* Fix configure bug when multiple invocations would not do the correct things.
* Better fully qualified domain name support.

  improvements.  Amplot requires gnuplot and a version of awk that
  understands command line variable assignment.
* Include amoverview which creates a list of each disk dumped and the level
  and success or failure of those dumps over a complete tapecycle.
* Amanda now supports backups of clients in different domains.  Requires
  using the configure --with-fqdn options and fully qualified domain
  names (FQDNs) in the disklist file.
* rth-changer checks all system calls for valid returns.
* no-changer and hp-changer use different status files and do more checking.
* amrestore works again with gzip compressed tapes.
* New setuid program rundump for systems where dump must run as root.
* Setuid programs are now installed o-rwx for tighter security.

  configure option, Amanda would not connect to the client machines.  This
  is now fixed.
* Rundump and runtar now check if the proper user is invoking them.
* Amanda now can use gdbm if the compatibility header files are not installed.
* Bug fixes for gnutar file exclusions.
* Fix bug in sendsize which would loop forever if debugging was not turned on.

  --with-pid-debug-files		use pid in /tmp debugging filenames
* Samba support must now be explicitly included using --with-smblcient.
* Amanda now compiles with K&R compilers.
* Better AIX, Linux, OSF support.
* configure checks if /dev/r devices exist or not.
* Amanda uses POSIX fcntl locking before flock or lockf locking if available.
* dumper.c uses less aggressive I/O values for SunOS server support.
* Many bug fixes in the configure script for various platforms.
* Many bug fixes to codes.

Changes in release 2.3.0.4b1
* Configuration now uses configure.  Build environment now uses
  automake and autoconf.
* Samba PC client backup support added.
* New programs and scripts:
  amrmtape: invalidate the contents of an existing backup tape
  amverify: check Amanda tapes for gnutar driven backups.
  hp-changer: script for a HP DAT changer.
  no-changer: make a single tape appear like an infinite count tape stacker.
* New options added to programs:
  amadmin: `amadmin <conf> version' shows version information.
  amtape: `amtape <conf> current' shows the current tape label,
* Amanda now supports server side compression of dumps on the tape
  host.  Use the srvcompress option in amanda.conf.
* Better gnutar support for indexing.  Amanda now lets you exclude
  files from the dump.
* Tape planning improvements.
* Email reports have better formating for disks with long mount points.
* Tighter DNS checking added to amandad.
* More debugging added to several programs.
* Amdump now calls amgetidx and amtrmidx.

Changes in release 2.3.0.3
* Amadmin uses regular expression matching to match disks.
* Expand the column width of the disk names from reporter.
* Contains amindex-0.2 from Alan McIvor.
* Many bug fixes.

Changes in release 2.3.0.2
* Bug fixes.

Changes in release 2.3.0.1
* Contains amindex-0.1 from Alan McIvor.
* Bug fixes.

Changes in release 2.3.0 alpha
* A number of material bugs fixed, including fixes incorporated into
  John Stoffel's WPI patches to amanda, which he called 2.2.6.5.
* Backup files larger than 2 GB now supported.  The current limit is
  2^31 Kbytes (2 terabytes), which should hold us for a few more years
  (1/2 :-).
* Support for GNUTAR-based backups.
* Support for writing to multiple tapes (sequentially) in one run.
* Support for multiple backups in parallel from the same client host.
* Records from the curinfo database can be exported and imported
  to/from a textual format.  This allows fixing a corrupted database by
  running the text version through a script and reimporting it.
  Individual records or the entire database can be exported/imported.

Changes in release 2.2.6
* A number of material bugs fixed.
* A lot of lint picked in the whole package.
* The documentation is now reasonably up to date.
* This version has been locally compiled and at least the client side
  tested on the following systems:
	SunOS 4.1.3	IRIX 5.2
	Solaris 2.3	BSDI BSD/386 1.1
	Ultrix 4.2	NetBSD 1.0
	DEC OSF/1 2.0	AIX 3.2
  I don't have any HP/UX machines locally to try it on, but I've
  tracked patches submitted by Neal Becker <neal@ctd.comset.com>, so
  I'm reasonably confident that 2.2.6 shouldn't be far from the mark on
  that platform.

Changes in release 2.2.5
* SYSV shared memory no longer required on server side if mmap is
  available.
* Supports GZIP compression.
* Supports use of mount names as well as device names in disk list
  (eg "/usr" instead of "sd0g").
* Amanda now thinks in real-time - you may run it several times a day
  if you wish, and it won't get confused.
* Supports Kerberos 4 security as well as BSD-style .rhosts, including
  encrypting files over the net.  The Kerberos support is available as
  a separate add-on package - see the file KERBEROS.HOW-TO-GET on the
  ftp site.
* Improved network protocol - faster startup, no longer dump specific,
  hooks in place for non-dump clients.
* Client-side checks in amcheck - can check sanity of all client hosts
  very quickly.
* Supports multiple holding disks, and load balances between them.
