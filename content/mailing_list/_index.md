# Where to get more information about Amanda
---
There are several channels available for Amanda support:

-   Amanda mailing lists (see below)
-   [Amanda forums](http://forums.zmanda.com)
-   [#amanda on IRC](../irc)

NOTE: You must be subscribed to a mailing list to send mail to it. Also,
the address you send from must match the address you subscribed with.

Additionally, there are size limits on messages to the lists ranging
from 40k-60k, (amanda-hackers is larger). If you are sending something
larger, your message will silently fail. Please trim logs down to the
relevant bits or put them up on the web and include a link in your
request. This is primarily as a courtesy to the thousands of people who
receive the emails.

Please note: **To subscribe or unsubscribe to a mailing list, DO NOT,
EVER, send mail to that list.**

Send mail to

##### \<listname\>-request@amanda.org

with the following line in the body of the message:

##### subscribe \<your-email-address\>

and when you want to unsubscribe, use the following line in the body:

##### unsubscribe \<your-email-address\>

where **\<listname\>** is one of the following:

**amanda-announce**

The amanda-announce mailing list is for important announcements related
to the Amanda Network Backup Manager package, including new versions,
contributions, and fixes.

NOTE: the amanda-users list is itself on the amanda-announce
distribution, so you only need to subscribe to one of the two lists, not
both.

To subscribe, send a message to
[amanda-announce-request@amanda.org](mailto:<amanda-announce-request@amanda.org>).

**amanda-users**

The amanda-users mailing list is for questions and general discussion
about the Amanda Network Backup Manager. This package and related files
are available via anonymous FTP from `ftp.amanda.org` in the
`pub/amanda` directory.

NOTE: the amanda-users list is itself on the amanda-announce
distribution, so you only need to subscribe to one of the two lists, not
both.

To subscribe, send a message to
[amanda-users-request@amanda.org](mailto:<amanda-users-request@amanda.org>).

**amanda-hackers**

The amanda-hackers mailing list is for discussion of the technical
details of the Amanda package, including extensions, ports, bugs, fixes,
and alpha testing of new versions.

To subscribe, send a message to
[amanda-hackers-request@amanda.org](mailto:<amanda-hackers-request@amanda.org>).

**amanda-cvs**

You should never send an e-mail to this list. Subscribers of this list
will receive an e-mail for every commit do to the cvs tree.

To subscribe, send a message to
[amanda-cvs-request@amanda.org](mailto:<amanda-cvs-request@amanda.org>).

There are searchable archives of the Amanda mailing lists:

-   Amanda Users (www.mail-archive.com/) [Amanda Announce
    (marc.info)](http://marc.info/?l=amanda-announce)
-   [Amanda Users
    (www.mail-archive.com/)](https://www.mail-archive.com/amanda-users@amanda.org)
    [Amanda Users (marc.info)](http://marc.info/?l=amanda-users)
-   [Amanda Hackers (marc.info)](http://marc.info/?l=amanda-hackers)

If you have problems with the mailing lists themselves (such as you
receive a bounce message indicating that amanda-users doesn't exist) or
some other problem where you suspect the lists are not functioning
correctly, please contact
[postmaster@amanda.org](mailto:postmaster@amanda.org)

**NOTE: The Egroups/Yahoo mailing lists \*DO NOT\* accept email messages
and you will get an error back indicating as much if you attempt to send
mail. If you want to send out email asking for help, you MUST send it to
the @amanda.org addresses listed above.**

If the mailing list support is insufficient, or you'd rather just search
out someone who may provide some degree of commercial support, go to the
[commercial support page](../support/commercial_support).

Some messages (mentioned in the Amanda distribution) about converting
from the flat file directory structure of amanda-2.4.0 to the tree
format used after that may be found here:
