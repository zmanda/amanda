# WHAT IS AMANDA?
AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a single master backup server to back up multiple hosts to a single large capacity tape or disk drive. Amanda uses native tools (such as GNUtar, dump) for backup and can back up a large number of workstations running multiple versions of Unix/Mac OS X/Linux/Windows.

# HISTORY
It was originally written by James da Silva while at the [University of Maryland's](https://www.umd.edu/) [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) where it was initially fielded.

Over time, Blair Zajac picked up around version 2.3.0 and took up the task of converting Amanda to use the GNU autoconf system for configuration.

After that, a core Amanda development team was created that has seen people come and go. The current list of people who considered developers (that is, they have write access to the CVS repository) can be found in the AUTHORS file in the top of the Amanda distribution.

After maintenance stopped being supported by the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), AMANDA moved it's CVS repository and main web site to [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/), where it lives today. The mailing lists left the department and the cs.umd.edu domain, and have been living at [amanda.org](/) compliments of [Omniscient Technologies](https://www.omniscient.com/) since January of 1998.

Today, Amanda's development is supported by [Zmanda](https://www.zmanda.com/lightning/).
