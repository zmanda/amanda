package Installcheck;

=head1 NAME

Installcheck - utilities for installchecks (not installed)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Installcheck;

  my $testdir = "$Installcheck::TMP/mystuff/";

  use Amanda::Debug;
  Amanda::Debug::dbopen("installcheck");
  Installcheck::log_test_output();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Miscellaneous utilities for installchecks. No symbols are exported by default.

=over

=item C<$TMP>

The temporary directory for installcheck data. This directory is created for you.

=item C<log_test_output()>

Calling this function causes status messages from tests (e.g. "ok 1 - some test")
to be recorded in the debug logs. It should be called exactly once.

=item C<get_unused_port()>

Find a local TCP port that is currently unused and not listed in
C</etc/services>.  This can still fail, if the port in question is bound by
another process between the call to C<get_unused_port()> and the port's
eventual use.
