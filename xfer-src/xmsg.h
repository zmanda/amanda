/* This module handles transmission of discrete messages from transfer
 * elements to the transfer master.  Messages have:
 *   an overall type (xmsg_msg_type)
 *   a version number
 *   a source (an XferElement)
 *   a number of attributes containing the message data
 *
 * Extensions to the protocol may add key/value pairs at any time without
 * affecting old implementations (that is, it is never an error to ignore
 * an unrecognized key).  Changes to the meaning of, or removal of,
 * existing keys from a message requires a version increment, which will
 * preclude older implementations from processing the message.  External
 * measures (such as amfeatures) should be employed in this case to ensure
 * backward compatibility.
 *
 * The implementation of messages is intended to sacrifice memory consumption
 * for speed and serializability.  Relatively few messages will exist at any
 * one time, but over the course of a dump, many messages will be created,
 * serialized, unserialized, and processed.
