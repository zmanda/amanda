<refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The Device API specifies a generic interface between Amanda and storage
devices such as tapes or disks.  This manual page describes the device
drivers included with Amanda.</para>

<para>This is a <emphasis>user-level</emphasis> description of the API, and
does not address details that are only of concern to developers.  For that
purpose, consult the Amanda source code and http://wiki.zmanda.com.</para>

<para>The term "device driver" describes the software that can communicate with
some kind of backend storage, e.g., a tape driver.  A "device" is the
  storage element itself, usually a piece of hardware. When discussing
  a device and its driver as a unit, the term  "device" is sometimes
  also used to refer to the combination of device and driver.</para>


</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>SPECIFYING DEVICES</title>

<para>Device names take the form <emphasis>TYPE:NODE</emphasis>, where <emphasis>TYPE</emphasis> selects a device driver, and <emphasis>NODE</emphasis> provides further information to that driver.  The syntax for each device driver is given in the corresponding section below.</para>

<para>Devices are described in &amconf; with "device" sections, e.g.,
<programlisting>
define device top_drive {
    tapedev "tape:/dev/nst0"
    device_property "BLOCK_SIZE" "131072"
}
</programlisting>
A device defininition creates a device "alias", in this case named <emphasis>top_drive</emphasis>, which can then be named in the global <emphasis>tapedev</emphasis> parameter:
<programlisting>
tapedev "top_drive"
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The global <emphasis>tapedev</emphasis> parameter can also specify a literal device name.  For example,
<programlisting>
tapedev "file:/amdisks"
</programlisting>
is equivalent to
<programlisting>
tapedev "default"
define device default {
    tapedev "file:/amdisks"
}
</programlisting>
Device properties specified outside of any device definition apply to all devices.  This syntax is provided mainly for backward compatibility, and for simple Amanda configurations.  Note that there is no way to provide properties specific to a device without defining a device alias.</para>

<para>See <citerefentry><refentrytitle>amanda.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
for more information on Amanda configuration.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>DEVICES</title>

<para>This section lists the device drivers included with Amanda, and basic instructions for using them.  For complete How-To information, consult the Amanda wiki at http://wiki.zmanda.com.</para>

<refsect2><title>Null Device</title>
<programlisting>
tapedev "null:"
</programlisting>

<para>The null device driver only supports writing, and discards all data.  It is
generally only useful for testing purposes.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>RAIT Device</title>
<programlisting>
tapedev "rait:tape:/dev/rmt/tps0d{4,5,6}n"
</programlisting>

<para>The RAIT device driver mirrors or stripes data over multiple "child" devices.
The child devices are specified using a shell-like syntax, where alternatives
are enclosed in braces and separated by commas.</para>

<para>With two child devices, the RAIT device driver mirrors data such that the
two devices contain identical data and can be used singly for
  recovery.  With more than two devices, the RAIT device "stripes"
  data across all but one device and writes a parity block to the
  final device, usable for data recovery in the event of a device or
  volume failure.  The RAIT device scales its blocksize as necessary
  to match the number of children that will be used to store data.</para>

<para>When a child device is known to have failed, the RAIT device should be reconfigured to replace that device with the text "ERROR", e.g.,
<programlisting>
tapedev "rait:{tape:/dev/st0,ERROR,tape:/dev/st2}"
</programlisting>
This will cause the RAIT device to start up in degraded mode, reconstructing the data from the missing device.
</para>

<para>Like ordinary RAID drivers, the RAIT device driver can automatically
enter degraded mode when one of its child devices fails.  However, the RAIT
device cannot automatically recover from any write error nor write any data in
degraded mode.  When reading, certain errors may be fatal (rather than causing
degraded mode).  And in any case, labels on all volumes must initially match
(labeled or otherwise).  If you have lost one volume from a set, explicitly
start the device in degraded mode as described above.</para>

<refsect3><title>Child Device Block Sizes</title>

<para>The RAIT device driver requires that all of its child devices use the
same block size.  If no block sizes are specified, the driver selects the block
size closest to 32k that is within the MIN_BLOCK_SIZE - MAX_BLOCK_SIZE range of
all child devices, and calculates its own blocksize according to the formula
<emphasis>rait_blocksize = child_blocksize * (num_children - 1)</emphasis>.  If
a block size is specified for the RAIT device, then it calculates its child
block sizes according to the formula <emphasis>child_blocksize = rait_blocksize
/ (num_children - 1)</emphasis>.  Either way, it sets the BLOCK_SIZE property
of each child device accordingly.</para>

</refsect3>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>S3 Device</title>
<programlisting>
tapedev "s3:foocorp-backups/DailySet1-"
device_property "S3_ACCESS_KEY" "MYACCESSKEY"
device_property "S3_SECRET_KEY" "MYSECRETKEY"
</programlisting>

<para>The S3 device driver uploads data to the Amazon S3 "storage cloud".  Its
device name is a slash-sparated combination of bucket name and prefix:
"s3:BUCKET/PREFIX".  Since buckets must be unique across all Amazon S3 users,
and since the number of buckets allowed to each user is limited, the driver can
store multiple Amanda volumes in a single S3 bucket, distinguished by prefix.
The prefix and slash can be omitted if they are not needed: "s3:BUCKET".</para>

<para>The access and secret keys used to authenticate to Amazon S3 are provided
as properties.</para>

<para>The S3 device driver stores each block in a distinct S3 object.  Due to
high HTTP overhead for each request, use of larger than normal block
  sizes (&gt; 1 megabyte) is reccomended with the S3 device.</para>

<para>You can control where your data is physically stored by Amazon S3 using 
a location constraint. Setting this affects can affect both billing and legal 
concerns, so you are encouraged to consult Amazon's documentation for details.
</para>

<para>
To control location constraints, set the S3_BUCKET_LOCATION property.
Currently, there are two valid settings: "" (any location) and "EU" (Europe).
If the S3_BUCKET_LOCATION is set, Amanda will check to make sure that the 
setting agrees with the constraint currently on the bucket.
</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>Tape Device</title>
<programlisting>
tapedev "tape:/dev/nst0"
</programlisting>

<para>The tape device driver interacts with a tape drive.  The device uses the
operating system's built-in tape support, which is generally similar to that
available via the command-line utilities dd(1) and mt(1).</para>

<para>The tape device name should specify a path to the operating system's
device file.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>VFS Device</title>
<programlisting>
tapedev "file:/path/to/vtape"
</programlisting>

<para>The VFS device driver stores data on a UNIX filesystem. Note
  that although one typically uses the VFS device driver to store data
  on hard disks, the driver does not interface with any hardware on a
  block level.</para>

<para>The device name specifies a path to a directory which must exist and
contain a "data/" subdirectory.  Each tape file is stored as a distinct file in
this directory, the name of which reflects the Amanda header in the tape file.
Block boundaries are not maintained: the driver supports reads of arbitrary
size, regardless of the blocksize used to write the data.</para>

</refsect2>

</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>PROPERTIES</title>

<para>Device drivers use <emphasis>properties</emphasis> as a generic means to
interact with other parts of Amanda.  Some properties are set by the device
driver and used by Amanda to determine how its devices should be used.  Other
properties can be set by Amanda or by the user to influence the driver's
behavior. Properties are set for a particular device, so that if you have two
tape devices, they will not share property values.</para>

<para>Properties are specified in <emphasis>amanda.conf</emphasis> with the
<emphasis>device-property</emphasis> parameter.  The syntax looks like this:
<programlisting>
device_property "FROBNICATOR_PATH" "/var/frobd/state"
device_property "BYTES_PER_FORTNIGHT" "128k"
device_property "USE_QUBITS" "no"
</programlisting></para>

<para>Both the property name and the property value are always quoted.  String
values are given as simple strings, like FROBNICATOR_PATH in the example above.
Integer values can be specified with any of the suffixes given in the "VALUE
SUFFIXES" section of &amconf;, like BYTES_PER_FORTNIGHT, above.  Boolean values
can be specified as any of "true", "yes", "1", "0", "no", "false", like
USE_QUBITS, above.  Some properties have special formats, as described
below.</para>

<para>Some properties are set based on other configuration values, such as
tapetype parameters.  These special cases are detailed under the appropriate
property, below.</para>

<para>The order in which device properties are set is as follows:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Tapetype parameters (including length, blocksize, and readblocksize) are translated into device properties and set accordingly.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Device properties from any device_property
    configuration parameters are set, in the order they appear in the
    configuration file.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist></para>

<para>Properties described as read-only are not accessible to users.  They are
listed here for completeness.</para>

<refsect2><title>COMMON PROPERTIES</title>

<para>Note that some of these properties are currently unused, and present only
for future expansion.  Not all devices implement all of these properties.</para>

<!-- PLEASE KEEP THIS LIST IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->

<variablelist>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>APPENDABLE</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This boolean property indicates whether this device supports appending data to volumes.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>BLOCK_SIZE</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This property gives the block size, in bytes, that will be used to write to the device.  The usual suffixes ("kbytes", etc.) are allowed.  The tapetype parameter <emphasis>blocksize</emphasis> sets this property.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>CANONICAL_NAME</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property contains the full canonical name for this device.  This name may not be the same as the user-supplied name, but is a valid name by which to access this device.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>COMPRESSION</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property represents the compression status of the device, and can be used to enable and disable such compression.  This applies mostly to tape devices, although many tape devices do not support setting compression from software.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>COMPRESSION_RATE</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property gives the compression rate, as a decimal ratio.  It may be a measured value over some unspecified period or a simple estimate.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>CONCURRENCY</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property indicates the level of concurrent access that this device supports.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>FREE_SPACE</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property gives the amount of free space available on the current volume, if known.  This is often an estimate; for example, tape devices can only estimate the amount of tape left on a spool.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>MAX_BLOCK_SIZE</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property gives the maximum block size this device can support.  See BLOCK SIZES, below.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>MEDIUM_ACCESS_TYPE</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property gives the type of the media in the device: read only, WORM (Write Once, Read Many), read/write, or write only.  Write-only devices do not support recovery, but the data are not necessarily thrown out.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>MIN_BLOCK_SIZE</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This property gives the minimum block size this device can support.  See BLOCK SIZES, below.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>MAX_VOLUME_USAGE</term><listitem>
 (read-write) On devices that support it, this property will limit the total amount of data written to a volume; attempts to write beyond this point will cause the device to simulate "out of space."  Zero means no limit.  The tapetype parameter <emphasis>length</emphasis> sets this property.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>PARTIAL_DELETION</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property indicates whether the device supports deletion of specific files.  Aside from linear tapes, most devices can support this feature.  It is currently unused by Amanda.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>STREAMING</term><listitem>
 (read-only) This property gives the streaming requirement for this device.  For example, tape drives often require a steady supply of data to avoid shoe-shining, while disk devices have no such requirement.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>VERBOSE</term><listitem>
 (read-write) If this boolean property is set, then the device will produce verbose debugging output.  This property is not recognized by all devices.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
</variablelist>

<refsect3><title>BLOCK SIZES</title>

<para>Amanda writes device data in blocks. On most devices the block
boundaries are embedded in the media along with the data itself, so subsequent
reads must use the same block sizes.  On tape devices, the block size is
dictated by the capabilities of the hardware -- buffer sizes, physical format,
and so on.</para>

<para>Amanda has historically supported a single, fixed block size -- usually
32k.  The Device API adds the ability to specify a block size at runtime, using
the BLOCK_SIZE property.  Devices provide MIN_BLOCK_SIZE and MAX_BLOCK_SIZE as
a guide to the range of acceptable block sizes. Note that this does not imply
that all sizes in the range MIN_BLOCK_SIZE - MAX_BLOCK_SIZE are available --
the device may require that block sizes are even multiples of some power of
two, for example.  Consult the documentation for your hardware and operating
system for more information.</para>

<para>Most devices are flexible enough to read a volume using a different block
size than that with which it was written.  This can be useful when handling old
volumes written with a smaller blocksize, or volumes of unknown blocksize.
Unfortunately, some tape devices do not detect oversized blocks correctly, and
may lose data if the configured block size is smaller than the volume's block
size.  The tape device driver has a READ_BUFFER_SIZE property which specifies
the minimum buffer size that will be allocated for reads from tape.  If the
hardware supports it, setting this property allows Amanda to correctly read
from tapes written with any blocksize less than or equal to READ_BUFFER
SIZE.</para>

<note><para>The RAIT device does not support flexible block sizes, as its
parity algorithm requires that all child devices have the same, fixed block
size.</para></note>

 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>S3_BUCKET_LOCATION</term><listitem>
 (read-write) Location constraint for buckets on Amazon S3.
Currently, it can be set to "", for no constraint (i.e. store data in the US), 
or "EU" (i.e. store data in the EU).
See Amazon's documentation for details and latest information
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>S3_SECRET_KEY</term><listitem>

 (read-write) Whether or not to use SSL/TLS to secure communications with Amazon S3.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>S3_USER_TOKEN</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This property specifies the user token for Amanda Enterprise Edition customers.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
</variablelist>

<para>Most Amanda devices work just fine without any properties, but not the S3
device.  A typical S3 configuration will have an access key and secret key
specified:

<programlisting>
device_property "S3_ACCESS_KEY" "27D3B8C6C4E7AA423C2B37C72A0D22C8"
device_property "S3_SECRET_KEY" "agphc2Q7Zmxragphc2RmO2xragpzZGY7a2xqCgr"
</programlisting></para>

</refsect3>

<refsect3><title>Tape Device</title>

<para>Most of these properties are automatically detected, but can be
overridden in the configuration file if the autodetection fails. Note that tape
drives are required to at least support the MTREW (rewind) operation; all other
operations can be emulated with the MTREW and read data operations.</para>

<!-- PLEASE KEEP THIS LIST IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->
<variablelist>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>BROKEN_GMT_ONLINE</term><listitem>

</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>BSF</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device
 driver may execute the MTBSF operation (backward seek file).
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>BSF_AFTER_EOM</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device
 driver should execute an MTBSF (backward seek file) operation after
 MTEOM (seek to end of recorded data) in order to append.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>BSR</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device
 driver may use the MTBSR operation (backward seek record).
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>EOM</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device
 driver may use the MTEOM command (seek to end of recorded data).
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>FINAL_FILEMARKS</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This integer property gives the number of filemarks that should be written at EOD.  It is usually 1 or 2.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>FSF</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device driver may use the MTFSF operation (forward seek file).
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>FSF_AFTER_FILEMARK</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device driver needs a FSF to go the next file after the filemark is read. Default to "TRUE" on Solaris and "FALSE" on all others machines.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>FSR</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the device driver may use the MTFSR operation (forward seek record).
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>NONBLOCKING_OPEN</term><listitem>
 (read-write) Set this boolean property to "true" if O_NONBLOCK must be used on the open call. Default to "true" on Linux and "false" on all others machines. Witout it, Linux wait for a few seconds if no tape are loaded. Solaris have strange error it is set to "yes".
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>READ_BUFFER_SIZE</term><listitem>
 (read-write) This property specifies the minimum buffer size that will be used for reads; this should be large enough to contain any block that may be read from the device, and must be larger than BLOCK_SIZE.  This property exists for tape devices which cannot determine the size of on-tape blocks, or which may discard data which overflows a small buffer.  The tapetype parameter <emphasis>READBLOCKSIZE</emphasis> sets this property.  See BLOCK SIZES, above.
