<refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>amlibvirtfsfreeze is an Amanda script implementing the Script API.
It should not be run by users directly.  On a machine that hosts
virtual machines, it uses <package>libvirt</package> to instruct
a virtual machine to freeze one or more filesystems, and then to thaw
them after their image files on the host have been backed up.</para>

<para>Freeze and thaw support in libvirt requires that a "guest agent"
(for example, <manref name="qemu-ga" vol="8"/> for a Linux guest) be installed
in the guest OS.</para>

<para>When a filesystem is frozen, any buffered changes are forced to storage
so the image can be backed up while consistent at the filesystem level.
Activity in the guest that modifies the filesystem may block until the
filesystem is thawed, so this technique is best combined with a script (such as
<manref name="amlvmsnapshot" vol="8"/>) to snapshot the host filesystem,
so the VM guest filesystems need only be frozen long enough to create
the snapshot on the host.</para>

<para>While a frozen filesystem will not be 'dirty' at the filesystem level,
freezing alone does not ensure that any files in that filesystem represent
consistent states of running applications. A guest agent may provide the
option to run a freeze-hook script in the guest OS just before freezing and
after thawing, and such a script can take application-specific actions to
ensure important applications have reached a consistent state and forced it
to storage as well. More on freeze hooks will be found in the documentation
for the guest agent being used.</para>

<para>The guest virtual machine ("domain" in libvirt parlance) is specified
by name in the DOMAIN property, and the MOUNTPOINT property (which can be
multivalued) specifies which of that domain's filesystems to act on.
The FREEZEORTHAW property specifies the action.
</para>

<para>For a thaw action, no MOUNTPOINT is specified, and all filesystems
frozen in the guest domain are thawed. For a freeze action, MOUNTPOINT may
need to be omitted if the virtualization software or guest OS are too old
to support per-filesystem freezing, and in that case, every filesystem mounted
on the guest is frozen.</para>

<para>This script can be run in PRE-DLE-ESTIMATE, in the case where one
snapshot will be made before estimating and removed after backup. If limited
free space in the volume group forces a small snapshot size, or changes to the
origin filesystem accumulate quickly, or the Amanda installation in total has
a long delay in planning/dumping between the estimate and backup phases, it is
possible to execute this script twice, on PRE-DLE-ESTIMATE and PRE-DLE-BACKUP,
in conjunction with a snapshot script that removes the snapshot used for
estimating and creates another one for backup. In that case, it would also
be possible to run this script only for PRE-DLE-BACKUP, as the estimate phase
can get the size of the image file accurately enough without needing it
frozen.</para>

<para>The phase (or both phases) must be set to be executed on the client:
<programlisting>
    execute-on  pre-dle-estimate
    #execute-on  pre-dle-estimate, pre-dle-backup
    execute-where client
</programlisting></para>

<para>The script is run as the amanda user, and must be able to run the
necessary <command>virsh</command> command. One approach is to set the
VIRSHEXECUTABLE property not to the actual path of the command, but to
a set-uid wrapper that takes the same arguments, checks that they represent
allowed operations, domains, and filesystems, and then executes the actual
command with the same arguments.</para>

<note><para>A set-uid wrapper obtains its owner's <emphasis>effective</emphasis>
ID, but may need to set the <emphasis>real</emphasis> ID to match it before
the <command>virsh</command> command will permit the operations.</para></note>
</refsect1>

<refsect2 id='trim'><title>Trimming before freezing</title>

<para>Another operation libvirt can request through the guest agent is to
<emphasis>trim</emphasis> filesystems (any specified with MOUNTPOINT, or all
filesystems if no mountpoint is given). The trim operation identifies all
blocks regarded as free by the filesystem, and reports them to the filesystem's
underlying block device as reclaimable. If the block device in the guest
presents an image file from the host, this may reduce the space taken by
the image on the host, by returning blocks to the host OS. Regular trimming
can counteract the steady growth of image files due to file creation and
deletion in the guest, especially if the guest filesystem is not mounted with
a <code>discard</code> option to report freed blocks to the device layer as they
are freed. A simple way to do regular trimming is to configure a DLE to trim
with this script, just before freezing the filesystem for regular backups, as
shown in the example below.</para>

<para>Whether trimming is possible, or has any effect, depends on support
in the virtualization system, guest OS and filesystem, and the image file
format used on the host. For Linux guests and qemu-kvm, an image file must
be presented via the <code>virtio-scsi</code> driver, not by the earlier
<code>virtio-blk</code>.</para>

<refsect1><title>PROPERTIES</title>

<para>This section lists the properties that control amlibvirtfsfreeze's
functionality.
See <manref name="amanda-scripts" vol="7"/>
for information on the Script API, script configuration.</para>

<!-- PLEASE KEEP THIS LIST IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->
<variablelist>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>DOMAIN</term><listitem>
The name of the libvirt domain, or guest VM, whose filesystems should be
frozen or thawed.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>FREEZEORTHAW</term><listitem>
One of the values <literal>freeze</literal> or <literal>thaw</literal>.
A third value, <literal>trim</literal>, is also allowed, to request trimming
filesystems as described in <xref linkend='trim'/>.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>MOUNTPOINT</term><listitem>
Filesystems in the named domain to be frozen or trimmed, identified by their
mountpoints. This property can have multiple values. It is ignored in a
<literal>thaw</literal> operation; all frozen filesystems will be thawed.
For some old versions of virtualization infrastructure, the guest agent, or
guest OS, it must not be used for <literal>freeze</literal> or
<literal>trim</literal> either, in which case all mounted filesystems will be
acted on.
</listitem></varlistentry>
 <!-- ==== -->
 <varlistentry><term>VIRSHEXECUTABLE</term><listitem>
Path to the <command>virsh</command> executable, search in $PATH by default.
If necessary for authorization, this can be set
instead to a set-uid wrapper that (after appropriate checks) will
execute <command>virsh</command> with the same arguments.
</listitem></varlistentry>

<refsect1><title>EXAMPLE</title>

<para>This example sets up three script definitions,
<literal>domfstrim</literal>, <literal>domfsfreeze</literal>,
and <literal>domfsthaw</literal>, all based on
this plugin, and a DLE that uses them, along with
<manref name="amlvmsnapshot" vol="8"/> and an assumed
<literal>remote-gtar</literal> dumptype, to first trim, and then freeze,
the root filesystems of several guest VMs running on a host, then snapshot
the host's filesystem (containing the consistent, frozen image files of the
guests), thaw the guest filesystems, and finally back up the host from the
snapshot.</para>

<para>Note the use of the ORDER option in script definitions. The default
(applied to the <literal>lvmsnapshot</literal> script, which leaves it
unspecified) is 5000. The explicit 3000 in the <literal>domfstrim</literal>
definition, 4000 for <literal>domfsfreeze</literal>, and 6000 for
<literal>domfsthaw</literal> ensure that,
when all four scripts are run in a single phase such as PRE-DLE-ESTIMATE,
the trims occur first, then freezes, then the snapshot, then the thaws.</para>

<para>In a realistic application where <command>amandad</command> does not
run as the superuser, a privileged wrapper may need to be written and named
in the VIRSHEXECUTABLE property as discussed above.</para>

<para>In <manref name='amanda.conf' vol='5'/>:
<programlisting>
 define script domfstrim {
   plugin "amlibvirtfsfreeze"
   execute-where client
   execute-on pre-dle-estimate
   property "freezeorthaw" "trim"
   property "virshexecutable" "/path/to/virsh-wrapper"
   order 3000 # must execute before libvirtfsfreeze 'freeze'
 }

 define script domfsfreeze {
   plugin "amlibvirtfsfreeze"
   execute-where client
   execute-on pre-dle-estimate
   property "freezeorthaw" "freeze"
   property "virshexecutable" "/path/to/virsh-wrapper"
   order 4000 # must execute before lvmsnapshot
 }

 define script domfsthaw {
   plugin "amlibvirtfsfreeze"
   execute-where client
   execute-on pre-dle-estimate
   property "freezeorthaw" "thaw"
   property "virshexecutable" "/path/to/virsh-wrapper"
   order 6000 # must execute after lvmsnapshot
 }

 define script "lvmsnapshot" {
   plugin "amlvmsnapshot"
   execute-where client
   execute-on pre-dle-estimate, post-dle-backup
   # ... see amlvmsnapshot.8
 }

 define dumptype remote-gtar # ...
</programlisting></para>

<para>And in <manref name='disklist' vol='5'/>:
<programlisting>
 example / /tmp/rootsnap {
   remote-gtar
   script {
     "domfstrim"
     property "domain" "vm1"
     property "mountpoint" "/"
   }
   script {
     "domfsfreeze"
     property "domain" "vm1"
     property "mountpoint" "/"
   }
   script {
     "domfsthaw"
     property "domain" "vm1"
   }
   script {
     "domfstrim"
     property "domain" "vm2"
     property "mountpoint" "/"
   }
   script {
     "domfsfreeze"
     property "domain" "vm2"
     property "mountpoint" "/"
   }
   script {
     "domfsthaw"
     property "domain" "vm2"
   }
   script {
     "lvmsnapshot"
     property "volumegroup"   "vg_example"
     property "logicalvolume" "lv_root"
     property "snapshotname"  "snap_root"
     property "extents"       "10%ORIGIN"
   }
 } 1 enet100
</programlisting></para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>BUGS</title>
<para>This script does not (yet) make any effort to detect failures, or to
capture and interpret standard output from the <command>virsh</command>, which
normally produces some. Uncaptured, such output mixes with Amanda's
client/server messaging, leading to backup failures. A cheap workaround is to
include <code>dup2(2,1)</code> in the wrapper that executes
<command>virsh</command>, so such output goes to standard error and ends up
in the client <command>amandad</command> log file.</para>
