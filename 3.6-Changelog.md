       correctly test for bad arguments,
       kill any older gpg agents,
       start a usable encryption process


## Branch 3_5-block-autolabel-from-erasing-tapes

- Purpose: set a default to disable auto-label from claiming non-amanda and "other-config" labels as if available
- Changes: Add a build flag to re-include options.  Block use of two enums for the features.  Change perl uses to null-set options.

    - `config/amanda/tape.m4`: adds build flag to prevent auto-label issues: "Define if unsafe erasure of tapes is allowed"

## Branch 3_5-add-unix-socket-to-rest-server

    - `server-src/amanda-rest-server.pl`: store starman Amanda rest server pid file in the @AMANDA_TMPDIR@ dir explicitly (/tmp/amanda by default)
    - `server-src/amanda-rest-server.pl`: explicitly put the amanda-rest-server error logs in @AMANDA_DBGDIR@ (/var/log/amanda by default)

---

- NOTE: important issues to handle in packaging
    - BUG#1) @amdatadir@ is used as if it was /var/lib/amanda
                when it is likely /usr/share/amanda and not writable nor permitted to write there
    - BUG#2) @AMANDA_TMPDIR@ is likely /tmp/amanda by default and therefore can be interfered with
    - BUG#3) $localstatedir/lib/amanda is used in several places without clear planning or detail
    - BUG#4) $localstatedir/amanda is used in several places without clear planning nor detail
    - BUG#4.1) $localstatedir/amanda if ever removed would need a clear migration to /var/lib/amanda
    - BUG#5) ~@CLIENT_LOGIN@ is maybe a dynamic / nfs-mounted dir!
    - BUG#6) much of this system seems prepared to use Dancer2.. yet dancer is mentioned !

## Branch 3_5-out-amsamba-only

- Purpose: various levels of work for over two years

## Branch 3_5-upgrade-gnulib

- Purpose: to upgrade the gnulib compiler/system-compatibility layer to version 37
- Changes:

    - `config/amanda/types.m4`:   substituted outdated operations needed for early in configure
    - `configure.ac`              varied the order to meet newer requirements for configure
    - `Makefile.am`               added an include gnulib directory for netinet
    - `config/gnulib/...`         updated files from gnulib-tool ---add-import --no-cv-files
    - `gnulib/...`                updated files from gnulib-tool ---add-import --no-cv-files
 
- The compatibility layer of gnulib has been useful for a very long time now in creating
usable appearances of modern standards on any old or aberrant system with an adequate C compiler
for a long time now.   As time progresses new function calls and includes can be added
that boost a system up to a modern level of C compatible ABI so that code can compile on
nearly any old or new system both.


## Branch 3_5-better-thread-naming-and-debug

- Purpose: to improve the debug output common code for all spawned processes (helps to organize logs)
- Changes:

    - `common-src/debug.c`: Setup and preserve program's argv[0] file name using ident_argv0 and init_ident_default()
    - `common-src/debug.c`: Create two variants (linux and non-linux) of get_debug_ident() to create a thread-identity string
    - `common-src/debug.c`: Add call into debug_printf() to insert the thread-identity string to the process-id
    - `common-src/debug.c`: Add a highly useful parent-pid note to log file header
    - `common-src/debug.c`: Remove excessive and unused info from log file (process exit) trailer info
