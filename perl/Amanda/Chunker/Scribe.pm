=head1 OVERVIEW

This package provides a high-level abstraction of Amanda's procedure for
writing dumpfiles to holding disk.

Amanda writes a sequence of chunkfile to a sequence of holding disk.

The details of efficiently write to holding disk are handled
by the low-level C<Amanda::Xfer::Dest::Chunker> subclasses.  The Scribe creates
an instance of the appropriate subclass. It calls a number of
C<Amanda::Chunker::Scribe::Feedback> methods to indicate the status of the dump
process and to request permission to use more holding disk.

=head1 OPERATING A SCRIBE

The C<Amanda::Chunker::Scribe> constructor takes one arguments:
C<feedback>.  It specifies the C<Feedback> object that will receive
notifications from the Scribe (see below).

  my $scribe = Amanda::Chunker::Scribe->new(
        feedback => $my_feedback);

Once the object is in place, call its C<start> method.

=head2 START THE SCRIBE

Start the scribe's operation by calling its C<start> method.
The method takes one parameters:

  $scribe->start(
        write_timestamp => $ts);

The timestamp will be written to each holding disk written by the Scribe

=head2 SET UP A TRANSFER

Once the Scribe is started, begin transferring a dumpfile.  This is a
three-step process: first, get an C<Amanda::Xfer::Dest::Chunker> object from the
Scribe, then start the transfer, and finally let the Scribe know that the
transfer has started.  Note that the Scribe supplies and manages the transfer
destination, but the transfer itself remains the responsibility of the caller.

The parameter to C<get_xfer_dest> are:

=over 4

=item C<max_memory>

maximun size to use on the holding disk.

=back

=head3 Start the Transfer

Armed with the element returned by C<get_xfer_dest>, the caller should create a
source element and a transfer object and start the transfer.  In order to
manage the holding chunk process, the Scribe needs to be informed, via its
C<handle_xmsg> method, of all transfer messages .  This is usually accomplished
with something like:

  $xfer->start(sub {
      my ($src, $msg, $xfer) = @_;
      $scribe->handle_xmsg($src, $msg, $xfer);
  });

=head3 Inform the Scribe

Once the transfer has started, the Scribe is ready to begin writing chunk to
holding disk.  This is the first moment at which the Scribe needs a header, too.
All of this is supplied to the C<start_dump> method:

  $scribe->start_dump(
      xfer => $xfer,
      dump_header => $hdr,
      filename => $filename,
      use_bytes => $use_bytes,
      chunk_size => $chunk_size,
      dump_cb => $dump_cb);

The c<dump_header> here is the header that will be applied to all chunk of the
dumpfile.  The only field in the header that the Scribe controls is the
cont_filename.  The C<dump_cb> callback passed to C<start_dump> is called when the
dump is completely finished - either successfully or with a fatal error.
Unlike most callbacks, this one takes keyword arguments, since it has so many
parameters.

  $dump_cb->(
        result => $result,
        size => $size,
        total_duration => $total_duration);

All parameters will be present on every call, although the order is not
guaranteed.

The C<result> is one of C<"FAILED">, C<"PARTIAL">, or C<"DONE">.  Even when
C<dump_cb> reports a fatal error, C<result> may be C<"PARTIAL"> if some data
was written successfully.

The C<holding_error> key points to a list of errors, each given as a string,
that describe what went wrong to cause the dump to fail.

The final parameters, C<size> (in bytes), C<total_duration> (in
seconds), and C<nparts> describe the total transfer, and are a sum of all of
the parts written to the device.  C<total_duration> reflects the time from the
C<start_dump> call to the invocation of the C<dump_cb>.

=head3 Cancelling a Dump

After you have requested a transfer destination, the scribe is poised to begin the
transfer.  If you cannot actually perform the transfer for some reason, you'll need
to go through the motions all the same, but cancel the operation immediately.  That
can be done by calling C<cancel_dump>:

  $scribe->cancel_dump(
	xfer => $xfer,
	dump_cb => $dump_cb);

=head2 QUIT

When all of the dumpfiles are transferred, call the C<quit> method to
release any resources and clean up.  This method takes a typical
C<finished_cb>.

  $scribe->quit(finished_cb => sub {
    print "ALL DONE!\n";
  });

=head2 GET_BYTES_WRITTEN

The C<get_bytes_written> returns the number of bytes written to the device at
the time of the call, and is meant to be used for status reporting.  This value
is updated at least as each part is finished; for some modes of operation, it
is updated continuously.  Notably, DirectTCP transfers do not update
continuously.

=head1 FEEDBACK

The C<Amanda::Chunker::Scribe::Feedback> class is intended to be
subclassed by the user.  It provides a number of notification methods
that enable the historical logging and driver/chunker interactions
required by Amanda.  The parent class does nothing of interest, but
allows subclasses to omit methods they do not need.

  $fb->notif_no_room($use_bytes, $mesg);

The C<request_more_disk> method provides a means for the caller
to ask for more holding disk.  It is called as

  $fb->request_more_disk(perm_cb => $cb);

All of the remaining methods are notifications, and do not take a
callback.

  $fb->scribe_notif_no_room();

The Scribe calls C<scribe_notif_no_room> when there is no more space allocated on the holding disk.

Finally, the Scribe sends a few historically significant trace log messages
via C<scribe_notif_log_info>:

  $fb->scribe_notif_log_info(
	message => $message);

A typical Feedback subclass might begin like this:

  package main::Feedback;
  use base 'Amanda::Chunker::Scribe::Feedback';

  sub request_more_disk {
    my $self = shift;
    my %params = @_;

    $params{'perm_cb'}->(cause => "config", message => "NOMORE HOLDIGN DISK SPACE!");
  }
